The analogous field-effect transistor circuit is the common drain amplifier and the analogous tube circuit is the cathode follower.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">The low output impedance allows a source with a large output impedance to drive a small load impedance; it functions as a voltage buffer. In other words, the circuit has current gain (which depends largely on the hFE of the transistor) instead of voltage gain, because of its characteristics it is preferred in many electronic devices. A small change to the input current results in much larger change in the output current supplied to the output load.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">One aspect of buffer action is transformation of impedances. For example, the Thévenin resistance of a combination of a voltage follower driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the voltage follower (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a voltage follower inserted between a small load resistance and a driving stage presents a large load to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a small load.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">This configuration is commonly used in the output stages of class-B and class-AB amplifiers. The base circuit is modified to operate the transistor in class-B or AB mode. In class-A mode, sometimes an active current source is used instead of RE (Fig. 4) to improve linearity and/or efficiency.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Voltage_follower.svg/302px-Voltage_follower.svg.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JCVBZd0eLEA_7DMoSTQ4CA8BNZgadbx_dCgd_4LwiAvvKAwJlvNHdkIESQ-q_6MWQY5TiDa7seMJVSnAhkcbLtvA9LVlmKzddFdocWJqeo1hYBIzWipEYtcWp9GqoFgr53gH6A5cGtl5xprpFQ" width="302" height="235"></p><br><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>REVIEW:</b></p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From</i> (<a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-collector-amplifier/">https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-collector-amplifier/</a>)</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Common-collector transistor amplifiers are so-called because the input and output voltage points share the collector lead of the transistor in common with each other, not considering any power supplies.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The common-collector amplifier is also known as an emitter-follower.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The output voltage on a common-collector amplifier will be in phase with the input voltage, making the common-collector a non-inverting amplifier circuit.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The current gain of a common-collector amplifier is equal to β plus 1. The voltage gain is approximately equal to 1 (in practice, just a little bit less).</p><p dir="ltr" style="">A Darlington pair is a pair of transistors “piggybacked” on one another so that the emitter of one feeds current to the base of the other in common-collector form. The result is an overall current gain equal to the product (multiplication) of their individual common-collector current gains (β plus 1).</p><br><br><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>Summary from Wikipedia: </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector</a></p><br></span><br><p></p></p>
