The analogous field-effect transistor circuit is the common-gate amplifier.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/NPN_common_base.svg/130px-NPN_common_base.svg.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T0uAC18ukhEZuQbDgeP86xdOvv7Ot8iQLEXUpbD-j4RdyMwY8MJ6_TwvaxVUfqFIC7LONCKo959Y7fUsp4ySu1PMnxj3ResmU6V_TErW0BsqvbSLHXtibKIpCy_9EqUazL06S0fcsNoTOUAJIA" width="130" height="190"></p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Application</b></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">This arrangement is not very common in low-frequency discrete circuits, where it is usually employed for amplifiers that require an unusually low input impedance, for example to act as a preamplifier for moving-coil microphones. However, it is popular in integrated circuits and in high-frequency amplifiers, for example for VHF and UHF, because its input capacitance does not suffer from the Miller effect, which degrades the bandwidth of the common-emitter configuration, and because of the relatively high isolation between the input and output. This high isolation means that there is little feedback from the output back to the input, leading to high stability.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">This configuration is also useful as a current buffer, since it has a current gain of approximately unity (see formulae below). Often a common base is used in this manner, preceded by a common-emitter stage. The combination of these two form the cascode configuration, which possesses several of the benefits of each configuration, such as high input impedance and isolation.</p><br><br><h4 style=""><span>Voltage amplifier[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_base&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6">edit</a>]</span></h4><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Common-base_small_signal.svg/300px-Common-base_small_signal.svg.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3JXSWnUgH0Xl2eZRQwBbtBwynFar1W-EQzFshVPaKHf1oajtfb8nhZIzLvgzskhThuy9YD-HnMZzhSo3Vq_3jxAPJGJk_Rgw_KRgOUd68UQZzuYkkkX3aG2Psr7e--DTKz8SsP23ATz07w7l6w" width="300" height="130"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Figure 2: Small-signal model for calculating various parameters; Thévenin voltage source as signal</p><p dir="ltr" style="">For the case when the common-base circuit is used as a voltage amplifier, the circuit is shown in Figure 2.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The output resistance is large, at least&nbsp;RC&nbsp;||&nbsp;rO, the value which arises with low source impedance (RS&nbsp;≪&nbsp;rE). A large output resistance is undesirable in a voltage amplifier, as it leads to poor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_division">voltage division</a>&nbsp;at the output. Nonetheless, the voltage gain is appreciable even for small loads: according to the table, with&nbsp;RS&nbsp;= rE&nbsp;the gain is&nbsp;Av&nbsp;= gm&nbsp;RL&nbsp;/ 2. For larger source impedances, the gain is determined by the resistor ratio&nbsp;RL&nbsp;/ RS, and not by the transistor properties, which can be an advantage where insensitivity to temperature or transistor variations is important.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">An alternative to the use of the hybrid-pi model for these calculations is a general technique based upon&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-port_network">two-port networks</a>. For example, in an application like this one where voltage is the output, a g-equivalent two-port could be selected for simplicity, as it uses a voltage amplifier in the output port.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">For&nbsp;RS&nbsp;values in the vicinity of&nbsp;rE&nbsp;the amplifier is transitional between voltage amplifier and current buffer. For&nbsp;RS&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;rE&nbsp;the driver representation as a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem">Thévenin source</a>&nbsp;should be replaced by representation with a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton%27s_theorem">Norton source</a>. The common base circuit stops behaving like a voltage amplifier and behaves like a current follower, as discussed next.</p><h4 style=""><span>Current follower[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_base&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7">edit</a>]</span></h4><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Common_base_with_Norton_driver.svg/300px-Common_base_with_Norton_driver.svg.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/n6AKHGBDJmf-qiIRZTzfBxHvx_o7Br8AYMxQ9qD1oB2Kv_-BxEIXQdhoQxuncEjDTrgRDE1PlMPqYojFZUsOs6UxhRdU6Qvge8YG7lnANVSO7LVxtvCSF7Tp8Kc7evXHVC0R4JNrCaFsrmTC_Q" width="300" height="228"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Figure 3: Common base circuit with Norton driver;&nbsp;RC&nbsp;is omitted because an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_load">active load</a>&nbsp;is assumed with infinite small-signal output resistance</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Figure 3 shows the common base amplifier used as a current follower.

Large output resistance is a desirable attribute of a current source because favorable&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_division">current division</a>&nbsp;sends most of the current to the load. The current gain is very nearly unity as long as&nbsp;RS&nbsp;&gt;&gt; rE.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">An alternative analysis technique is based upon&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-port_network">two-port networks</a>.
