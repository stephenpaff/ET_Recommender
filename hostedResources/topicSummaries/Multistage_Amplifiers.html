The gain of the whole amp is the product of the gains of each stage. &nbsp;So if stage one has a gain of 15 and stage two has a gain of 10, the multi-stage amp has a gain of 150.</p><h4 style=""><b>Structure</b></h4><p dir="ltr" style="">A multi-state amp consists of two or more stages, where each stage is a single-transistor amplifier circuit. &nbsp;The outputs of each stage (except the last) are sent to the input of the next stage by some kind of coupling circuit. &nbsp;Assuming the stages are common emitter amps, the circuit structure looks conceptually like this:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img

height="249"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">There are four kinds of coupling circuits: &nbsp;RC,LC, transformer and direct. &nbsp;&nbsp;The structure and behavior of each will be discussed in turn.</p><h4 style=""><b>Structure and behavior of RC coupling</b></h4><p dir="ltr" style="">For an RC coupling between stages, the collectors have a resistor and a capacitor, as shown inside the yellow circles here:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nMCqUyuMUIlUbucd86j_-seU7sAQ9PWIlUuqoTN6vGfjmcIltmgcAngtwRCvx8I2vN1WCX0oQph9G-v7ZZ5XtddihF2C2Kpn64rv3US43naFMOLtOAG0eiLUA2rRccP2szKRXB3N" width="498" height="329" alt="RC coupling.png"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">If the signal frequency is high enough, the capacitors act as a short circuit to the signal. &nbsp;However, if the signal frequency is too low, then the capacitors have impedence, which sends some of the signal upward through the resistors, thus lowering the gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Structure and behavior of LC coupling</h4><p dir="ltr" style="">Even if the input signal has a high frequency and the capacitors of the RC coupling act mostly as a short, a small part of the signal is lost upwards through the resistors, thus reducing gain. &nbsp;To prevent this, the resistors can be replaced by inductors, as shown here:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hHxH3-Vc-vV2Lz8xKj3aNoInkFuMTThWHYNR0etvdJXj5rzLe9Hpo9XTh3yjPOKwo4_4bsH7Q055eguBzvgbnHr7E0-XFAukKVhF6dPe6LgzFkoeYK6F6O4Q-L_BZD6vPeMUx7v6" width="498" height="304" alt="LC coupling.png"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Like resistors at the collectors, the inductors pass DC in order to bias the transistors properly. &nbsp;However, the effectively block high frequency AC, so more of the signal goes through the capacitors. &nbsp;Thus, for high frequency applications, such as Radio Frequency (RF) amps, inductors are sometimes used despite being more expensive than resistors.</p><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Structure and behavior of transformer coupling</h4><p dir="ltr" style="">When an amplifier is intended to pass only a very narrow band of frequencies, transformer coupling can be used. &nbsp;It has the following structure:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nCf_IPohBt2OiRXBk3I00dFHm09kT2xYxnIgc55fX0fetqcQEYGA_LIrb2Elfqs3sv5ZsZIa6Ac57OZg4GDnPZQeZOeDtpcrLLHKS97BlCptkm54MXB_Bqh5PeX2-B160LDR82u1" width="512" height="251" alt="Transformer coupling.png"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The combination of a capacitor and the primary coil of the transform form a tank, or tuned, circuit. &nbsp;This allows only a narrow band of frequencies to pass to the next stage, which can be useful in radios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Structure and behavior of direct coupling</h4><p dir="ltr" style="">Using capacitors, inductors and transformers makes the amplifiers gain vary with the frequency of the signal. &nbsp;If this is a problem, then direct coupling can be used, as shown here:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uSd6N18EAgXF_q2-AaIuNW5DlX3WIMy-cEX-ySm6jhSfSq8YhPgEYVV5rg2LqQss_LffYh03MWj23FsD239N6BBGCil7FpIhd1ZxsPS3JUJj0cJqrY_J86R_maTg4fC91KMJuCNr" width="418" height="228"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Direct coupling is used for low frequency application or when the frequency of the input signal has a wide range. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the characteristics of the transistors govern the gain, and they can vary with operating characteristics such as temperature changes. &nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">One type of direct coupled transistor amplifier is called a Darlington transistor or Darlington pair. &nbsp;Two transistors are conatin in a single case or integrated circuit. &nbsp;Both transistors share the same collector, as shown here:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/76d2NHNfuTg6Jw8thPKKlCF-e7cuB3r1Nxq0PUmHHkhoZhqikhClWb8MbuMRPnr1uW6gUBKqrfhvpunLX4soaEV1U3zX2w8Q1k6RODo8uLKGAwveRpz4qojVEfmcVO59EcziJcWD" width="118" height="131"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">This is the both the circuit itself and the schematic symbol used for Darlington pairs. </p><br><br><p></p></p>
