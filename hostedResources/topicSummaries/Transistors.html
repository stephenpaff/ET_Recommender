<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Function</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="">Transistors are used mostly as the main components in amplifiers and switches. &nbsp;They are always combined with other devices which supply appropriate voltages. &nbsp;Those voltages control how the transistor behaves and hence what it is useful for.</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Structure</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="">A bipolar-junction transistor (BJT) has three terminals, named the collector, emitter and base. &nbsp;There are two types of transistor: PNP and NPN. &nbsp;They operate the same way but the voltages and currents are reversed. &nbsp;Below are the schematic symbols for both:</p>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Behavior</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="">A transistor behaves like two diodes and two current sources, as shown below for an NPN transistor:</p>

<p dir="ltr" style=""><span>The amount of current delivered by each current source (the circles) is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the opposite diode. &nbsp;That is, the current generated by the collector current source is a constant (F) times the current through the emitter diode (Ied), and the current generated by the emitter current source is a different constant (R) times the current through the collector diode (Icd).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style=""><span>Typically, the voltages supplied to a transistor cause one diode to be reverse biased and the other to be forward biased. &nbsp;This means that the current through one diode is zero, so the opposite current source generates zero current. &nbsp;This allows one to view the transistor in a simpler way. &nbsp;For instance, when the collector diode is reverse biased, and the emitter diode is forward biased, one diode and one current supply can be removed from the picture, and an NPN &nbsp;transistor can be view as this:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HapdrG6FKJxx7-h9-Zry-OhlI3juPzKtuQrGuA99AaOY-cONb__G0EEqCKqNFHleQtiQhF6jlNgTfp78c2ZUDgrjEXtDe7xEeQSwuo07x8_Zs1jiwj1RIMZwuOmfOu0IM7xi_p6l" width="305" height="177"></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">The dotted line indicates that the current into the base controls the current into the collector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><span>In particular, if you work through the math, then it turns out that Ic = Ib* (F / (1-F)). &nbsp;Because this relationship is so important and commonly used, it is simplified by defining a new constant, , which is defined to be (F / (1-F)), and thus we have Ic = *Ib. &nbsp;That is, the collector current is beta times the base current. &nbsp;Typically beta is around 100, so the collector current is much larger than the base current. &nbsp;Beta varies from one transistor to another, and it can vary with temperature, too.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style=""><span>Because a weak current into the base can controls a powerful current into the collector, the transistor can be used as an amplifier (the collector current is proportional to the base current) or a switch (the collector current can be turned off if the base current is turned off).</span></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><span>However, the relationship Ic=*Ib assumes that the transistor is properly biased. &nbsp;For instance, if there isn’t enough voltage at the collector, then Ic will not be as high as*Ib</span></p><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Physics</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="">A transistor is composed of three layers of silicon doped to be either PNP or NPN. &nbsp;The middle layer is the base, and it is very thin. &nbsp;To explain how the transistor works, we have to assume something about the voltages applied to it, since without any voltages applied, it just sits there. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HapdrG6FKJxx7-h9-Zry-OhlI3juPzKtuQrGuA99AaOY-cONb__G0EEqCKqNFHleQtiQhF6jlNgTfp78c2ZUDgrjEXtDe7xEeQSwuo07x8_Zs1jiwj1RIMZwuOmfOu0IM7xi_p6l" width="305" height="177"></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="">Let’s first assume the transistor has its junctions biased as shown in the image above, where the emitter-base junction is forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased. The electrons flows freely across the forward biased emitter-base junction. &nbsp;&nbsp;In a regular diode, the electrons cannot cross the reverse biased collector-base junction. &nbsp;However, because there is a nearby flow of electrons, which are travelling through the narrow base on their way to the emitter, a proportion of these electrons get swept across the reverse-biased junction, so electrons flow into the collector even though the collector-base junction is reverse biased. &nbsp;Moreover, the more electrons moving through the base on their way to the emitter, the more electrons that get swept into the collector. &nbsp;Thus, the size of the emitter-base current controls the size of the collector-base current. &nbsp;The mode of operation is called active.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="">But that only happens when the junctions are biased as described above. &nbsp;When the collector-base junction is forward biased and the emitter-base junction is reverse biased, then the same thing happens but to the opposite terminals. &nbsp;That is, the collector current controls the emitter current. This mode of operation, which is called reverse-active, is rarely used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There are four logically possible ways to bias the two junctions; we’ve covered two. &nbsp;The third one is both junctions are reverse biased. &nbsp;This means that no current flows. &nbsp;This mode is called cutoff.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The fourth mode of operation has both junctions forward biased. This allows current to flow easily across both. &nbsp;This mode of operation is called saturation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Cutoff and saturation modes are useful for making the transistor behave as a voltage-controlled switch. &nbsp;Active mode is used mostly for amplification.</p><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</h4>
<p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9MfGAk_GembjPfAJh-MJvURNrgyh_t6DWuksNB_05Tl75w1-WudIA6qa8_Q6cpLPV6EnHxdPebI9DFLAb0r1UIvHufAtuHG7HCXb2BZFO4MyVoQgBgPjRXSoxYcMWEWbWXmmCDsn" width="458" height="311"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The main parameter of transistors is called beta, and it corresponds roughly to the constant F in the diagram above. &nbsp;More specifically, it is the ratio of the collector current to the total base current. Beta is typically around 100 to 300. &nbsp;That is, the current flowing into the collector is 100 to 300 times larger than the current flowing into the base. &nbsp;That’s a pretty amazing “theft.” &nbsp;Of the electrons that start at the base and head toward the emitter, more than 99% get “stolen” by the collector. &nbsp;However, the exact value of beta is not easily controlled by manufacturers. &nbsp;Two supposedly identical transistors may have widely different values for beta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style=""><span>The minor parameters for transistors are just what you would expect from diodes. &nbsp;When a junction is forward biased, it drops about 0.7 volts, the “knee” voltage. &nbsp;&nbsp;When a junction is reverse biased, it acts like an open circuit and lets no current pass. &nbsp;The junctions have breakdown voltages, but unlike a Zener diode, transistors are not designed to be operated in their avalanche or breakdown regions; they will be destroyed by trying to do so.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style=""><span>There is one small caveat. &nbsp;When a junction is forward biased, it actually has a small resistance. &nbsp;The size of the resistance varies with the amount of current flowing through the junction. &nbsp;It can vary from a few ohms to a few hundred ohms. &nbsp;Usually, this tiny resistance doesn’t matter. &nbsp;However, when a particular circuit requires that you use the fact that there is a small resistance even though the junction is forward biased, then the problem will tell you how large a resistance to assume.</span></p><p></p></p>
