That is, the amplifier for the positive part pushes current into the load, and the amplifier for the negative part pulls current out of the load. Push-pull amplifiers are often use as the last stage of a multi-stage amplifier. They have high current gain,low output resistance, high efficiency and low distortion.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">There are two basic kinds of transistor push-pull amplifiers: common emitter (CE) and common collector (CC). They will be discussed separately.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Structure and behavior of the CC push-pull amplifier</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">The CC push-pull amplifier uses two CC single-transistor amp, which means that the signal enters the base and the output is taken off the emitter. They are arranged as shown below.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vxBQQ7uAuW7ZjJs_4sPdTR9WCKQFbCKRdtX8WrepiyVHYHaKRx_PH7TO_jaG-bGGaV4ZT3byNnXb4hiL2sSsnXCOG7wTqYZ7Wsn-cqEhDC7ArWuBwcMnh9zRguWATsA-4AV5aclA" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oLFgedFYiy8XvTAaLGjJ7p_UZzjc3IZ0b1VGndnsw7z4JmXqP-vWbmg3cbH_L-ttZSDN7StnFHSV2R1tQH_Rt8K3670RPiHidtr3jhVefmx1lJrfhwANDTJ3EURqK8JFU3UoQfZC853sz99M9Q" width="518" height="310"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Notice that one transistor is PNP and the other is NPN. Transistors must be biased so that when the input signal is zero, their base voltage are sitting right at the knee voltage for the transistor. Thus, when the signal move just a little ways, the BE junction becomes either forward biased or reverse biased. In particular, if the signal moves in the positive direction, the the upper transistor enters the active region (BE junction is forward biased) and the lower transistor becomes cutoff (BE junction is reverse biased). If the signal move in the negative direction, then the lower transistor turns on and the upper turns off. In order to get exactly the knee voltage across the junctions, one can use either forward biased diodes as in the right schematic, or or carefully chosen resistor values, as in the left schematic. So that’s all there is to know about the DC biasing of the circuit.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Now lets examine the behavior of the circuit as the input oscillates. When it swings positive, it doesn’t go anywhere close to the positive supply voltage, so the upper diode stays forward biased, dropping exactly the knee voltage. Thus, the voltage at the base rises right along with the rising input signal. The emitter stays at zero (ground), so the rising base voltage cause current to flow through the BE junction, which causes the collector current to rise as well. Meanwhile, because the base voltage of the bottom transistor rose, its BE junction become reverse biased, and no collector current flows. Hence, the collector current flowing into the upper transistor exits through thee emitter and has to go through the load. That is, the upper transistor pushes current through the load resistor.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Now let’s look at what happens when the current swings negative. This causes both base voltages to become more negative. The top transistor turns off (no collector current) and the bottom transistor’s collector current is proportional to the base current, which is itself proportional to the input signal. Hence, the bottom transistor draws current in via the emitter, pulling the current through the load resistor. That is, the lower transistor pulls.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">The end result is that the input signal is replicated as current through the load resistor, but the load current is much higher than the input signal current.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Structure and behavior of CE push-pull amplifiers</b></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">A CE push-pull amplifier has transistors in the common emitter configuration, which means that the signal enters the base and the output is taken from the collector. The two CE amps are arranged as follows:</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="CE push pull.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yS8brtEcFR7LzWNeiRipeQp5F54v47GuxnnBTHqCsYvZscLHCGnxKLJVHnTmXYgB6iAR1G-AMqZOyzKtZOK9XRpMTw6JHvGCMI8Li5tVBTEbqt3Lxv8IiJlbkmdkkpoyH7BOqLhmm-qF9hWUOg" width="504" height="418"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The circuit uses two center-tapped transformers, which makes it expensive and bulky. </p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">As with the other kind of push-pull amplifier, the DC biasing must be designed so that both transistors are on the boundary between cutoff and active regions. That is, top bias resistor is chosen so that it drops exactly 0.6 volts; the knee voltage of the top transistor. Similarly, the bottom bias resistor also drops exactly 0.6 volts.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Now let’s see what happens when the signal swings positive. This causes the upper terminal of the secondary of T1 to swing positive, thus putting the upper transistor into its active region. The lower terminal of the secondary of T1 swings negative, making the BE junction of the lower transistor reverse biased and thus shutting off its collector current. The collector of the upper transistor draws current from the primary of T2, whose center tap is connected to the power supply. This causes a similar current to be pulled from the top of the load.&nbsp;</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">When the input swings negative, the lower transistor enters its active region, and its collector pulls current from the lower part of the secondary of T2. This means the current directions in T2 are reversed from what they were when the upper transistor was active. Thus, the secondary of T2 pushes current into the top of the load resistor. Hence, the upper transistor pulls load current and the lower transistor pushes load current.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Push-pull amplifiers use two “complementary” or matching transistors, one being an NPN-type and the other being a PNP-type with both power transistors receiving the same input signal together that is equal in magnitude, but in opposite phase to each other. This results in one transistor only amplifying one half or 180°&nbsp;of the input waveform cycle while the other transistor amplifies the other half or remaining 180°&nbsp;of the input waveform cycle with the resulting “two-halves” being put back together again at the output terminal.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Then the conduction angle for this type of amplifier circuit is only 180°&nbsp;or 50% of the input signal. This pushing and pulling effect of the alternating half cycles by the transistors gives this type of circuit its amusing “push-pull” name, but are more generally known as the&nbsp;Class B Amplifier&nbsp;as shown below.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Class B Push-pull Transformer Amplifier Circuit</b></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="class b amplifier circuit" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q__sjtN2tgcpvKp1iLGZ2B4ryMp_6PrY4mgH2HDZEXnK3GIToGHntisZsgkiNXH0zxwoes5eQXCpkEEz8xn5pHOTE-hAOA7r3OPdC_qlrAcl977SZgd1Sdxhb39ZS-TfLkTz3zMzWNQXPI4Gyg" width="536" height="403"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The circuit above shows a standard&nbsp;Class B Amplifier&nbsp;circuit that uses a balanced center-tapped input transformer, which splits the incoming waveform signal into two equal halves and which are 180o&nbsp;out of phase with each other. Another center-tapped transformer on the output is used to recombined the two signals providing the increased power to the load. The transistors used for this type of transformer push-pull amplifier circuit are both NPN transistors with their emitter terminals connected together.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Here, the load current is shared between the two power transistor devices as it decreases in one device and increases in the other throughout the signal cycle reducing the output voltage and current to zero. The result is that both halves of the output waveform now swings from zero to twice the quiescent current thereby reducing dissipation. This has the effect of almost doubling the efficiency of the amplifier to around 70%.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Unlike the DC condition, these alternating currents are&nbsp;ADDITIVE&nbsp;resulting in the two output half-cycles being combined to reform the sine-wave in the output transformers primary winding which then appears across the load.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Class B Amplifier&nbsp;operation has zero DC bias as the transistors are biased at the cut-off, so each transistor only conducts when the input signal is greater than the&nbsp;base-emittervoltage. Therefore, at zero input there is zero output and no power is being consumed. This then means that the actual Q-point of a Class B amplifier is on the&nbsp;Vce&nbsp;part of the load line as shown below.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Class B Output Characteristics Curves</b></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="class b amplifier characteristics" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YKxdJawPstWrNK-QRqibrc3IKzCyO88v83BIMFo0TRzfze26BQ2tbz4B0BXuLjNDIpfBOONXwl1C2lWDzSvEDL3xnHyoAaKHuF4f7jPSRVgiUY2e8AlCQ1oTFp90K7NQ8acv3Qap4bqXSOfVQA" width="355" height="385"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The&nbsp;Class B Amplifier&nbsp;has the big advantage over their Class A amplifier cousins in that no current flows through the transistors when they are in their quiescent state (i.e., with no input signal), therefore no power is dissipated in the output transistors or transformer when there is no signal present unlike Class A amplifier stages that require significant base bias thereby dissipating lots of heat – even with no input signal present.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">So the overall conversion efficiency (&nbsp;η&nbsp;) of the amplifier is greater than that of the equivalent Class A with efficiencies reaching as high as 70% possible resulting in nearly all modern types of push-pull amplifiers operated in this Class B mode.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Transformerless Class B Push-Pull Amplifier</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">One of the main disadvantages of the Class B amplifier circuit above is that it uses balanced center-tapped transformers in its design, making it expensive to construct. However, there is another type of Class B amplifier called a&nbsp;Complementary-Symmetry Class B Amplifier&nbsp;that does not use transformers in its design therefore, it is transformerless using instead complementary or matching pairs of power transistors.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">As transformers are not needed this makes the amplifier circuit much smaller for the same amount of output, also there are no stray magnetic effects or transformer distortion to effect the quality of the output signal. An example of a “transformerless” Class B amplifier circuit is given below.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Class B Transformerless Output Stage</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="class-B amplifier output stage" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VPm-8FHXspdj-OZl8MWnUplN8uaLxbhuTGaO3N6FowiAi3CCaGCpXb81kVOVzGnXZXOiuZ6mSK9L72YZevBTY4G4tTWBbK89pJZuibG-24qFktXPk-IiwsfzMhlio6LxmtPtiJH2qKCz9sUohQ" width="417" height="302"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The Class B amplifier circuit above uses complimentary transistors for each half of the waveform and while Class B amplifiers have a much high gain than the Class A types, one of the main disadvantages of class B type push-pull amplifiers is that they suffer from an effect known commonly as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/amplifier/amp_7.html">Crossover Distortion</a>.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Hopefully we remember from our tutorials about&nbsp;Transistors&nbsp;that it takes approximately 0.7 volts (measured from base to emitter) to get a bipolar transistor to start conducting. In a pure class B amplifier, the output transistors are not “pre-biased” to an “ON” state of operation.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This means that the part of the output waveform which falls below this 0.7 volt window will not be reproduced accurately as the transition between the two transistors (when they are switching over from one transistor to the other), the transistors do not stop or start conducting exactly at the zero crossover point even if they are specially matched pairs.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The output transistors for each half of the waveform (positive and negative) will each have a 0.7 volt area in which they are not conducting. The result is that both transistors are turned “OFF” at exactly the same time.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">A simple way to eliminate crossover distortion in a Class B amplifier is to add two small voltage sources to the circuit to bias both the transistors at a point slightly above their cut-off point. This then would give us what is commonly called an&nbsp;Class AB Amplifier circuit. However, it is impractical to add additional voltage sources to the amplifier circuit so PN-junctions are used to provide the additional bias in the form of silicon diodes.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>The Class AB Amplifier</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">We know that we need the&nbsp;base-emitter&nbsp;voltage to be greater than 0.7v for a silicon bipolar transistor to start conducting, so if we were to replace the two voltage divider biasing resistors connected to the base terminals of the transistors with two silicon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode_1.html">Diodes</a>, the biasing voltage applied to the transistors would now be equal to the forward voltage drop of the diode. These two diodes are generally called&nbsp;Biasing Diodes&nbsp;or&nbsp;Compensating Diodes&nbsp;and are chosen to match the characteristics of the matching transistors. The circuit below shows diode biasing.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Class AB Amplifier</b></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="Class AB Transformerless Output Stage" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VWODCDn0cTAnTC5blysilddd5dnGdTEbrg6Fw4yGjx8IIhIsMep4lO5lqrCkTBiLaTsA2k44Fz3o7TZcgMjAWdGwVyw8B2DBzmYbX7RlKfpWS6c1Wu45EXAoysnj1CS5AxyFrmm16j8aiE-ShA" width="319" height="302"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The&nbsp;Class AB Amplifier&nbsp;circuit is a compromise between the Class A and the Class B configurations. This very small diode biasing voltage causes both transistors to slightly conduct even when no input signal is present. An input signal waveform will cause the transistors to operate as normal in their active region thereby eliminating any crossover distortion present in pure Class B amplifier designs.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">A small collector current will flow when there is no input signal but it is much less than that for the Class A amplifier configuration. This means then that the transistor will be “ON” for more than half a cycle of the waveform but much less than a full cycle giving a conduction angle of between 180° to 360°&nbsp;or 50 to 100% of the input signal depending upon the amount of additional biasing used. The amount of diode biasing voltage present at the base terminal of the transistor can be increased in multiples by adding additional diodes in series.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Class B amplifiers&nbsp;are greatly preferred over Class A designs for high-power applications such as audio power amplifiers and PA systems. Like the class-A amplifier circuit, one way to greatly boost the current gain (&nbsp;Ai&nbsp;) of a Class B push-pull amplifier is to use Darlington transistors pairs instead of single transistors in its output circuitry.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In the next tutorial about amplifiers we will look more closely at the effects of Crossover Distortion in Class B amplifier circuits and ways to reduce its effect.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Additional resources:</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">From Electronics Tutorial: <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/amplifier/amp_6.html">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/amplifier/amp_6.html</a></p></span><br><p><br></p></p>
