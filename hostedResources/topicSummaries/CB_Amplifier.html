However, it is popular in integrated circuits and in high-frequency amplifiers, for example for VHF and UHF, because its input capacitance does not suffer from the Miller effect, which degrades the bandwidth of the common-emitter configuration, and because of the relatively high isolation between the input and output. This high isolation means that there is little feedback from the output back to the input, leading to high stability.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">This configuration is also useful as a current buffer, since it has a current gain of approximately unity. Often a common base is used in this manner, preceded by a common-emitter stage. The combination of these two form the cascode configuration, which possesses several of the benefits of each configuration, such as high input impedance and isolation.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><br></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>REVIEW:</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Common-base transistor amplifiers are so-called because the input and output voltage points share the base lead of the transistor in common with each other, not considering any power supplies.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The current gain of a common-base amplifier is always less than 1. The voltage gain is a function of input and output resistances, and also the internal resistance of the emitter-base junction, which is subject to change with variations in DC bias voltage. Suffice to say that the voltage gain of a common-base amplifier can be very high.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The ratio of a transistor’s collector current to emitter current is called α. The α value for any transistor is always less than unity, or in other words, less than 1.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><br></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Function</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The common-base transistor amp is typically used for impedance matching. Low impedance inputs are matched to high impedance loads. The input is applied to the emitter, and the output is taken from the collector. The output is in phase with the input. The voltage gain is high, the current gain is low and the power gain is low. The input resistance is low and the output resistance is high.</p><b><br></b><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Behavior</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The input signal voltage is resisted only by the resistance of the forward biased base-emitter junction, which is typically around 100 ohms. Thus, a very weakly fluctuating voltage will still create a moderately large swing in current. The current through the emitter is split between the base and the collector in such a way that the collector gets beta times more than the base. That is, the collector gets beta/(1+beta) times the emitter; this ratio is called alpha, and is of course close to 1. That is, most of the input current signal passes through to become the AC component of the collector current. This can be pushed through a large load, RL, leading to a large gain in voltage compared to the input voltage.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><br></p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Other resources:</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Summary from Wikipedia:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_base">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_base</a><br></p><p dir="ltr" style="">From <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-base-amplifier/">https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-base-amplifier/</a><br></p></span><br></p>
