These two points have different charges, one is higher and the other is lower. The difference between these two points of the charge is how we measure the voltage. &nbsp;The unit of “volt” is the name of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who created the first chemical battery. &nbsp;The letter “V” represents voltage.</p></li></ul><li dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><p dir="ltr">Current</p></li><ul style=""><li dir="ltr" style=""><p dir="ltr" style="">Current is how fast the charge is flowing. The higher the charge, the faster the current. Current has to do with electrons flowing in a circuit. Current measures how fast the electrons go. The unit of the current is “ampere,” and usually, a person writes it as “amps”. The letter “I” can represent as current.</p></li></ul><li dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><p dir="ltr">Resistance</p></li><ul style=""><li dir="ltr" style=""><p dir="ltr" style="">Resistance is how much the circuit resists the flow of the charge. This makes sure the charge does not flow too fast and damage the components. In a circuit, a light bulb can be a resistor. If electrons flow through the light bulb, then the light bulb will light up. If the resistance is high, then the light will be darker. The unit of resistance is “Ω”, &nbsp;which is called omega, and pronounced “ohm”, it is the name of the inventor of Ohm’s law.</p></li></ul></ul><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Ohm's law says that in an <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit" style="">electrical circuit</a>, the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current" style="">current</a> passing through a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor" style="">resistor</a> between two points, is related to the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage" style="">voltage</a> difference between the two points, and inversely related to the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance" style="">electrical resistance</a>&nbsp;between the two points. This relation is shown in the following</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>R = V / I</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Where I is the current in <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere">amperes</a>, V is the potential difference in <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt">volts</a>, and R is a constant, measured in <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm">ohms</a>, called the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance">resistance</a>.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Current is directly proportional to voltage loss through a resistor. That is, if the current doubles, then so does the voltage. To make a current flow through a resistance there Fo must be a voltage across that resistance. Ohm's Law shows the relationship between the voltage (V), current (I) and resistance (R). It can be written in three ways:</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;">I = V / R; or V = I * R; or R = V / I</p><br><h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Kirchhoff's current law</h3><p dir="ltr" style="">Kirchhoff's current law is also known as Kirchhoff's first law and Kirchhoff's junction law. This law states that 'The sum of current into a junction equals the sum of current out of the junction'. This is the same as Kirchhoff's junction law. In a junction, the&nbsp;<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge" style="">electric charge</a>'s sum preservation law is applied. The figure gives an example. If the entering value of the current is i2 and i3, and this current splits into the current of i1 and i4, then the equation (i1 + i4 = i2 + i3) is satisfied.</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hV9m3H4qT1ri8KPZ8JuepB8MAmsWBG1Sfz6zCHZWkoECAqMz-UU2BAZZi627rmIA8NlL9E4Lea9pIc6pvBfCFMpt19q0Zjd9x7tr1a6osScodsTSuXZLlMEYlDDe7HyA_IRMh97CRkop7MHe9Q" width="196" height="195" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/KCL.png"></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Thus, Kirchhoff's first law is that a charge is not destroyed or created in a junction point. This is based by an electric charge preservation law</p><h2 dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;">Kirchhoff's voltage law</h2><p dir="ltr" style="">Kirchhoff's voltage law is also known as Kirchhoff's second law, a closed circuit law, and Kirchhoff's loop law.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The algebraic sum of the voltage (potential) differences in any loop must equal zero. (This circuit is a closed circuit) Any complex circuit can be divided into many closed circuits. This law means that in the circuit there is an electric cell and electric resistance. The electric cell gives the charge a electromotive&nbsp;<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics)" style="">force</a>, and then the electric resistance dissipates this force. But in electric resistance, if the direction of the resistance is opposite of the current, the resistance adds to the electromotive force. Thus, Kirchhoff's second law is based on potential energy preservation law.</p><p dir="ltr" style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qqxJlzsPVecisDHUvI7DTpWpHSsSfio94uopqTaKRPKcc_pLn2rTZP2sF8hb10fxPX-1pWhK8ht6I71VJ7Q26cSRtvddITYM7iEJ2lqpVqmolSqhECNONIha48bPePc12kYX8iZ75RhBtP_GaA" width="197" height="169" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/KVL.png"></p><br>
