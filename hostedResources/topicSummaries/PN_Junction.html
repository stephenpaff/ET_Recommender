The "p" (positive) side contains an excess of holes, while the "n" (negative) side contains an excess of electrons in the outer shells of the electrically neutral atoms there. This allows electrical current to pass through the junction only in one direction.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Pn-junction-equilibrium.png/400px-Pn-junction-equilibrium.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GWSKQMi3c3TbIF7nS8ks1QrK98txOQ1F6WgX1F9vLl_4Aj5uEqyxetGCsIUu9b23cZDvT3jNwz6P9FAPZnP5fOKdTJU-PrfgyVqXQSkqg5LDcY0Ub7rkQEJCUdfcuzakja-YknV4OMxN4tWbnQ" width="400" height="249"></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">From wiki (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrinsic_semiconductor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrinsic_semiconductor</a>)</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>N-type</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">N-type semiconductors have a larger electron concentration than hole concentration. The term n-type comes from the negative charge of the electron. In n-type semiconductors, electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the minority carriers. N-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with donor impurities (or doping a p-type semiconductor as done in the making of CMOS chips). A common dopant for n-type silicon is phosphorus.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>P-type</b></p><p dir="ltr" style="">As opposed to n-type semiconductors, p-type semiconductors have a larger hole concentration than electron concentration. The term p-type refers to the positive charge of the hole. In p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. P-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with acceptor impurities (or doping an n-type semiconductor). A common p-type dopant for silicon is boron.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">PN junctions are established in a semiconductor when there is an abrupt transition from p-type material to n-type material. &nbsp;The transition generally is established in a single crystal with p-type and n-type regions established by doping or ion implantation. &nbsp;A semiconductor diode involves a single pn junction. &nbsp;A transistor is either of PNP type or NPN type, In a PNP transistor, a thin region of electron-rich material separates two regions of primarily electron poor semiconductor. &nbsp;In an NPN transistor two regions in which conduction is primarily by electron motion are separated by a thin strip of material in which the dominant charge carrier is the electron hole. </p><p dir="ltr" style=""> </p><p dir="ltr" style="">When a battery is connected to a pn junction, we say it is forward biased if the p side is positive with respect to the n side. &nbsp;Then holes move from the p region to combine with electrons at the interface and the junction offers little resistance. &nbsp;If, the interface is reversed biased then the electrons and holes are each pulled away from the interface leaving a non-conductive region at the interface.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From</i> (<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode">https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode</a>)</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Diode_3D_and_ckt.png/220px-Diode_3D_and_ckt.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_JdLzbYcaArdd0TZQGsFlLAXbCUKSaZopecmZ8qhBtQyddXCl5h55TIwQL_UKPijCumGDhEdVplATWjRScGqxvl0B2Vaqk2hiezQwWC_1B3I6lGgffItPFE4913VdaK-nDw1KJs3ZuZgifNvsA" width="220" height="95"></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">A diode is an electronic component with two electrodes (connectors). It allows electricity to go through it only in one direction. Diodes can be used to convert alternating current to direct current (Diode bridge).</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">If you give positive voltage to the p-side and negative voltage to the n-side, the electrons in the n-side will want to go to the positive voltage at the p-side and the holes of the p-side will want to go to the negative voltage at the n-side. Because of this, current flow is able to exist, but it takes a certain amount of voltage to get this started (very small amount of voltage is not enough to get the electric current to flow). This is called the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage of a silicon diode is at about 0.7 V. A germanium diode needs a cut-in voltage at about 0.3 V.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">If you instead give negative voltage to the p-side and positive voltage to the n-side, the electrons of the n-side want to go to the positive voltage source instead of the other side of the diode. Same thing happens on the p-side. So, current will not flow between the two sides of the diode. Increasing the voltage will eventually force electric current to flow (this is the break-down voltage). Many diodes will be destroyed by a reverse flow but some are made that can survive it.</p><br><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From Wikipedia:</i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction</a>)</p></span><br><p><br></p></p>
