The gain is a strong function of both temperature and bias current, and so the actual gain is somewhat unpredictable. Stability is another problem associated with such high-gain circuits due to any unintentional positive feedback that may be present.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/NPN_common_emitter_degeneration.svg/130px-NPN_common_emitter_degeneration.svg.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DNFMRtR_c0m0JiyCFjMsjs36_P_6ePoqhlgILmUsjvbUbCdnuzI0rI7ndCBbZskL7FQMDghgV4bpRAnIkrR-yYFwraoizE3EzPNvA7mybiNy4ITR-1X2hd1dNsACey4vybIT0zQ2XNBnL2pxnA" width="130" height="218"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">The voltage gain depends almost exclusively on the ratio of the resistors RC/RE rather than the transistor's intrinsic and unpredictable characteristics. The distortion and stability characteristics of the circuit are thus improved at the expense of a reduction in gain.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From all about the circuit</i> (<a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-emitter-amplifier/">https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-emitter-amplifier/</a>)</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">It is called the common-emitter configuration because (ignoring the power supply battery) both the signal source and the load share the emitter lead as a common connection point</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>Output Characteristics Curves</b></p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From </i>(<a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/amplifier/amp_2.html">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/amplifier/amp_2.html</a>)</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><img alt="collector characteristics" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hudgv1ARlTOWsOwlnotrX3nKhZwmKR-Qr2QHxpQWYXQIx6iuOc8w0fkuSnZHBZd2P6M5RyOnLQJFQyXVbMh5VosWPofinw3xRIh0URO2BgUoX1fh5MEqpuglHLTVndIbtgbABZiZ0y_tTJGHug" width="504" height="553"></p><p dir="ltr" style="">Point Q on the load line gives us the Base current Q-point of Ib = 45.8μA or 46μA. We need to find the maximum and minimum peak swings of Base current that will result in a proportional change to the Collector current, Ic without any distortion to the output signal.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">As the load line cuts through the different Base current values on the DC characteristics curves we can find the peak swings of Base current that are equally spaced along the load line. These values are marked as points N and M on the line, giving a minimum and a maximum Base current of 20μA and 80μA respectively.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">These points, N and M can be anywhere along the load line that we choose as long as they are equally spaced from Q. This then gives us a theoretical maximum input signal to the Base terminal of 60μA peak-to-peak, (30μA peak) without producing any distortion to the output signal.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Any input signal giving a Base current greater than this value will drive the transistor to go beyond point N and into its “cut-off” region or beyond point M and into its Saturation region thereby resulting in distortion to the output signal in the form of “clipping”.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Using points N and M as an example, the instantaneous values of Collector current and corresponding values of Collector-emitter voltage can be projected from the load line. It can be seen that the Collector-emitter voltage is in anti-phase (-180o) with the collector current.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">As the Base current Ib changes in a positive direction from 50μA to 80μA, the Collector-emitter voltage, which is also the output voltage decreases from its steady state value of 5.8v to 2.0v.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Then a single stage Common Emitter Amplifier is also an “Inverting Amplifier” as an increase in Base voltage causes a decrease in Vout and a decrease in Base voltage produces an increase in Vout. In other words the output signal is 180o out-of-phase with the input signal.</p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><b>REVIEW:</b></p><br><p dir="ltr" style=""><i>From</i> (<a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-emitter-amplifier/">https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-4/common-emitter-amplifier/</a>)</p><br><p dir="ltr" style="">Common-emitter transistor amplifiers are so-called because the input and output voltage points share the emitter lead of the transistor in common with each other, not considering any power supplies.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Transistors are essentially DC devices: they cannot directly handle voltages or currents that reverse direction. To make them work for amplifying AC signals, the input signal must be offset with a DC voltage to keep the transistor in its active mode throughout the entire cycle of the wave. This is called biasing.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">If the output voltage is measured between emitter and collector on a common-emitter amplifier, it will be 180o out of phase with the input voltage waveform. Thus, the common-emitter amplifier is called an inverting amplifier circuit.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The current gain of a common-emitter transistor amplifier with the load connected in series with the collector is equal to β.
